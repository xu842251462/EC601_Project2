Phase1:

Twitter APIs
When I want to following from the twitter api, I can use following_lookup. I get this program from twitter API. I connect it with my bear token. I also connect it to my twitter id. 
In this program, requests and json lib are used. Using get and bear_auth will help me to fetch data from database.
